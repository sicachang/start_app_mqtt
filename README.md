Eclipse Mosquitto
=================

Mosquitto is an open source implementation of a server for version 5.0, 3.1.1,
and 3.1 of the MQTT protocol. It also includes a C and C++ client library, and
the `mosquitto_pub` and `mosquitto_sub` utilities for publishing and
subscribing.

## Installing

1. Install the appropriate installation file by confirming the operating system and bits support of your computer <https://mosquitto.org/download/>.
-In my case, `mosquitto-2.0.11-install-windows-x64.exe` works well on my WIN10 PC (64bits))

## Quick start

If you have installed a binary package the broker should have been started
automatically. If not, it can be started with a basic configuration:

    mosquitto

Then use `mosquitto_sub` to subscribe to a topic:

    mosquitto_sub -t 'test/topic' -v

And to publish a message:

    mosquitto_pub -t 'test/topic' -m 'hello world'
